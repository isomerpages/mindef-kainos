<p style="text-align: justify;">The U.S. Army is experimenting with what it calls the aerial tier network, airborne assets that can relay information, reduce reaction times and help resolve communication breakdowns in areas where foliage, mountains and buildings impede signals. This would also tie in with the transition to Multi-Domain Operations. The value of an aerial tier was recognised during Project Convergence 21.</p>
